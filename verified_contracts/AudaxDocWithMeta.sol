ENTROPY TOKEN SALE TERMS
If you pay us what we ask for,
we promise to assign a number of Entropy Tokens to your address,
or return your unused payment to you.
These are the Terms.

Important Notice
* Do not apply or pay for Entropy Tokens unless you fully understand what you are
paying for and you accept the risks.

* Before applying, please read Entropy Foundation’s current Token Disclosure
Statement (TDS) for a summary of significant features and risks.
No disclosure document (including any white paper) can fully cover all features and
risks, so please carefully consider your situation before applying.
Entropy Foundation’s current TDS is on Entropy Foundation’s Website and may be
updated from time to time.

* The futures of HUT34, the Entropy Foundation and Entropy Token are highly
speculative.
There is no assurance of the future performance of any of them.
Participation in HUT34 and the Token Sale is targeted for developers. It is not
suitable for speculators or for financial investment.

* These Terms are binding on the offer we make to you and on the sale of Entropy
Token to you.
No other terms (whether written by you or us or implied) affect these Terms unless
they are mandatorily imposed by law and we cannot contract out of that.

* You can only apply for Entropy Token through our Website.
You must accept and agree to be bound by these Terms for your participation in the
Token Sale.
No-one other than Entropy Foundation is authorised to offer or to make
statements on behalf on behalf of Entropy Foundation. Guard against scams,
phishing and hackers.

* You are not offered any financial product, financial service or investment
opportunity.

Do not apply for Entropy Token for speculative financial gains.

There is no regulated disclosure document or token sale process applying to the
Token Sale.

If any country’s laws prohibit or specifically regulate any part of the Token
Sale under financial or securities laws, then no offer or sale may occur under
the Token Sale as far as those laws actually apply.
Entropy Foundation may cancel, limit, transfer or modify any step of the Token
Sale to ensure compliance with the Terms and any country’s laws.

Terms
1. Application of these Terms
1.1 These terms (as amended from time to time – see clause 17.18) exclusively govern the legal
relationship between you (Applicant) and Entropy Foundation in the Token Sale. This includes
receiving, controlling and holding Entropy Tokens and your use of the Website, subject only to
any law which cannot be excluded by these Terms.
1.2 The Token Sale includes the offer made to you, your application, our decision whether to
accept your application (in full or in part) and our completion of all accepted offers.
1.3 If you participate in the Token Sale, you will be deemed to have conclusively and irrevocably
accepted all of the Terms (without any counter-offer, amendment or ancillary agreements or
terms asserted by you). You cannot counter-offer or change these Terms. If you do not agree
to these Terms, then do not participate in the Token Sale.
1.4 Entropy Foundation controls the Token Sale. No other person represents or binds Entropy
Foundation in the Token Sale.
2. Timing of Token Sale
2.1 The Token Sale will begin at the Commencement Time and will end at the Closing Time. Those
dates (and times) will be specified on the Website.
2.2 Entropy Foundation may change the Commencement Time or the Closing Time in its absolute
discretion. Any such changes will be notified on the Website and will be effectively immediately
at the time of being published on the Website (without any other notice).
2.3 Entropy Foundation may in its absolute discretion end the Token Sale and may withdraw any
offers to allocate or to assign Entropy Tokens before the Closing Time (for clarity, without
having to amend the Closing Time or to give notice to anyone).
3. Website
3.1 Entropy Foundation may, in its absolute discretion and without giving prior notice:
(a) vary, modify, add or remove features, or amend any content on the Website; and
(b) block or restrict access to, or terminate, withdraw or suspend use of, the Website or any
part of the Website.
Those changes apply to you whether or not you continue to access or to use the Website.
No Entropy Foundation Person will be liable for any Loss which is incurred as a result of such
action.
3.2 Entropy Foundation may remove any user generated content from the Website:
(a) in its absolute discretion and without giving prior notice; and
(b) at the request of a user.
3.3 Entropy Foundation Persons are not responsible for, and will not be liable for, any user
generated content posted to the Website. Entropy Foundation Persons will not be liable for any
Loss arising from such content or from the failure of Entropy Foundation to moderate, delete or
correct any such content.
3.4 Entropy Foundation may arrange for the Website to accept registrations of interest in the Token
Sale. Any registration of interest is limited to a facility to advise registrants of the availability of
the Token Sale and to receive news and updates. It is not an application for Entropy Token and
gives no right to allocations to Entropy Tokens. All registrants are solely responsible for taking
the steps to apply for Entropy Tokens as set out on the Website (in accordance with these
Terms). (For clarity, such a facility to accept registrations of interest will be different from any
facilities for allocations prior to the public availability of the Token Sale.)
3.5 The Website may contain hyperlinks to websites which are not maintained or controlled by
Entropy Foundation. All hyperlinks to such websites are provided as a convenience to you.
Use of the hyperlinks and access to such websites is entirely at your own risk. No Entropy
Foundation Person is responsible for any third-party content contained in websites linked to the
Website. No Entropy Foundation Person is liable for any Loss arising from accessing, using or
relying on such websites.
3.6 The inclusion of any hyperlink does not imply endorsement by Entropy Foundation of such
websites. Entropy Foundation is not the partner, associate, agent or other representative of any
person who is named on the Website or whose trademark, service marks, logo, insignia or other
device is used on or appears on websites to which the Website is linked.
4. Token Sale
4.1 Applicant must apply to buy Entropy Tokens only through the Website.
4.2 By applying for Entropy Token through the Website, Applicant irrevocably agrees to these
Terms (as may be amended after their application in accordance with these Terms).
4.3 All applications for Entropy Token are irrevocable. They may not be withdrawn prior to the end
of the Token Sale with the express written consent of Entropy Foundation notified to Applicant.
4.4 Any applications which are not allocated in full or in part as at the end of the Token Sale
automatically lapse.
4.5 Entropy Foundation may terminate the Token Sale at any time, without notice, and regardless of
the amount of Entropy Tokens allocated.
4.6 Applicant’s application to buy Entropy Tokens is subject to Entropy Foundation’s sole discretion
to accept the application, in whole or in part.
4.7 Entropy Foundation will comply with all express written representations it makes on its Website
about the Token Sale. This includes, but is not limited to, caps on issuance, pricing and
allocation of Entropy Tokens.
4.8 The TDS does not provide any representation, warranty, undertaking, assurance or give rise to
any other conduct (or omission) which affects these Terms or which independently gives any
person any legal rights or expectations.
4.9 The fixed limit on the total number of Entropy Tokens is 100,000,000 Entropy Tokens. The limit
that will be generated will be referenced in the smart contract code for the Entropy Token. (see
clause 9.1.)
4.10 Applicant must pay Entropy Foundation for the number of Entropy Tokens applied for at the
price offered by Entropy Foundation and in the forms (including digicurrencies or fiat currencies)
notified on the Website. The offered price (as notified on the Website) may differ according to
the timing of applications and the number of Entropy Tokens applied for. Entropy Foundation
decides how to apply the pricing which is stated on the Website from time to time.
4.11 Applicant acknowledges that failure to follow the Token Sale instructions on the Website or any
difficulties in transferring payment may limit, delay, or prevent Applicant from applying for and
acquiring Entropy Tokens. Any questions about such instructions should be directed to
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5a3b3e3733341a322f2e696e74333574">[email protected]</a>&#13;
4.12 Entropy Foundation will pay Applicant, or return to the control of Applicant (as the case may be)&#13;
any amount of payment or other consideration which is in excess of the amount required to&#13;
settle Applicant’s payment obligation to acquire Entropy Tokens allocated to Applicant.&#13;
Applicant accepts that there may be delays or procedural issues in arranging payment to&#13;
Applicant due to third party systems (such as digicurrency exchanges or e-wallets).&#13;
4.13 There is no cooling off period on or after allocation of the Entropy Tokens to Applicant.&#13;
4.14 Allocation of Entropy Tokens to Applicant is irreversible and irrevocable. There is no refund or&#13;
compensation to Applicant for the number (if any) of Entropy Tokens allocated (or not allocated)&#13;
to Applicant.&#13;
4.15 Allocations of Entropy Tokens to Applicant will only be made in accordance with the details&#13;
provided by Applicant.&#13;
4.16 The only official and authorised Token Sale website URL operated by Entropy Foundation is&#13;
https://hut34.io/entropySale Applicant is solely responsible for ensuring that the URL of their&#13;
web browser indicates that it is using a hypertext transport protocol secure connection (“https”)&#13;
and that the domain name used by them is correct.&#13;
4.17 Entropy Foundation does not support or endorse any third party website or service which&#13;
accepts payment in relation to Entropy Tokens, provides Entropy Tokens during the Token Sale&#13;
or facilitates either of these things in any way during the Token Sale or at any time up to the&#13;
launch of HUT34. Entropy Foundation has no relationship in any way with such other parties or&#13;
services. Applicants are urged not to use any third party service which claims to offer such&#13;
services.&#13;
4.18 By participating in the Token Sale or receiving, controlling and holding Entropy Tokens, to the&#13;
extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that no other party (including, without limitation&#13;
any Entropy Foundation Person) may be held liable for any Loss arising out of, or in any way&#13;
connected to, your participation in the Token Sale or receiving, controlling and holding Entropy&#13;
Tokens in any manner other than via the Website.&#13;
4.19 By applying for and being allocated Entropy Tokens, to the extent permitted by applicable law&#13;
you may not hold any Entropy Foundation Person liable for any Loss arising out of, or in any&#13;
way connected to, your failure to secure properly and to keep private your email address and&#13;
any password or private key used in connection with the Token Sale. Applicant accepts the risk&#13;
that if Applicant does not maintain an accurate record of these, then Applicant will lose control&#13;
over or access to Entropy Tokens (without any compensation for that or any allocation or&#13;
transfer of substitute Entropy Tokens).&#13;
4.20 Entropy Foundation may arrange for offers, invitations and allocations of Entropy Tokens before&#13;
or during the Token Sale. Nothing in these Terms limits or prevents Entropy Foundation from&#13;
allocating Entropy Tokens, at different prices, and on different terms from these Terms.&#13;
5. Creation of Entropy Tokens&#13;
5.1 Entropy Tokens will be assigned to successful Applicants within 14 days after the day of the&#13;
Closing Time. (This period allows for reconciliation of applications and payments, resolving&#13;
payment details and for integrity reviews.)&#13;
5.2 For the purposes of the Token Sale, all Entropy Tokens assigned as a result of the Token Sale&#13;
will be publicly viewable at the Etherscan.io website (subject to continued maintenance of that&#13;
website by its owner).&#13;
6. Main purposes of Token Sale&#13;
6.1 The two main purposes of the Token Sale are to generate Entropy Tokens to be used in HUT34&#13;
and to receive payment for the assignment of those Entropy Tokens sold in the Token Sale.&#13;
6.2 The payment or other consideration received by Entropy Foundation for the assignment of&#13;
Entropy Tokens will be applied in its absolute discretion towards the development and&#13;
marketing of HUT34 and for general expenses of Entropy Foundation. No representation,&#13;
undertaking or assurance is given as to precise use or the timing of use of the consideration&#13;
received by Entropy Foundation for assigning Entropy Tokens.&#13;
6.3 Entropy Tokens carry no right to or other legal interest in Entropy Foundation, Hut34 or the right&#13;
to control or to be compensated for any decision by Entropy Foundation with respect to its&#13;
business, its use of its funds or its decisions if and how to develop Hut34.&#13;
7. Obligations of Applicant for Token Sale&#13;
7.1 Applicant is solely responsible for determining if they can legally participate in the Token Sale&#13;
and receive and hold Entropy Tokens, including but not limited to whether Applicant’s&#13;
participation in the Token Sale is subject to the laws of Applicant’s jurisdiction or other laws&#13;
applying to Applicant. No refund or other compensation will be given if Applicant or an Entropy&#13;
Token Owner later claims they were not entitled to, or were prohibited from, participating in the&#13;
Token Sale, including but not limited to applying for, being assigned or acquiring control over&#13;
Entropy Tokens. The contract for allocating Entropy Tokens will not be fundamentally breached&#13;
by any such asserted legal incapacity.&#13;
7.2 Applicant is solely responsible for ensuring the validity of all of their blockchain payments to&#13;
Entropy Foundation in the Token Sale.&#13;

HUT34 nor can they reasonably be expected to remain current, especially due to HUT34&#13;
undergoing development in volatile conditions.&#13;
(b) Applicant and each other Entropy Token Owner accepts and acknowledges that any&#13;
publications by or on behalf of Entropy Foundation may not be relied upon as&#13;
representations, undertakings, assurances or guarantees nor as partial or complete&#13;

Foundation.&#13;
(c) Applicant and each other Entropy Token Owner is solely responsible for assessing the&#13;
features and risks of acquiring Entropy Tokens (independently of, and without any&#13;

looking statements and opinions about Entropy Tokens and the Token Sale by or on behalf of&#13;
any Entropy Foundation Person are excluded to the extent permissible by law.&#13;

independent advice for the purpose of deciding whether to participate in the Token Sale.&#13;
13.2 Applicant expressly confirms for the benefit of Entropy Foundation and each other Entropy&#13;
Foundation Person that Applicant is participating in the Token Sale and will be assigned, control&#13;
and hold Entropy Tokens at their own legal, financial and business risk and that Entropy Tokens&#13;
are provided on an “as is” basis without any warranties, representations or opinions of any kind,&#13;
whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of title or implied warranties,&#13;
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose except only to the extent expressly stated in&#13;
the Terms or as imposed by law and which may not by these Terms be modified, limited or&#13;
excluded&#13;
13.3 Without limiting clause 13.2, no Entropy Foundation Person warrants or undertakes that the&#13;
process for participating in the Token Sale or being assigned or controlling and holding Entropy&#13;
Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free.&#13;
13.4 Applicant expressly confirms for the benefit of Entropy Foundation and each other Entropy&#13;
Foundation Person that each Entropy Foundation Person may rely on these Terms and&#13;
Applicant’s acceptance of these Terms as confirmation that each Entropy Foundation Person&#13;
other than Entropy Foundation may also rely on these Terms as a complete bar to any&#13;
proceedings by or in the name of Applicant (or another Entropy Token Owner) to the extent&#13;
those proceedings assert or rely on the claim that the Entropy Foundation Person does not&#13;
have the benefit of these Terms by reason of not being a party to any agreement by Applicant&#13;
made pursuant to or in relation to these Terms or due to not being expressly named in these&#13;
Terms (or both).&#13;
14. Disclaimers, exclusions and limitations of liability&#13;
14.1 To the extent Token Sale Documents include forward-looking statements or other statements&#13;
that appear to make a statement about future conduct or performance:&#13;
(a) Entropy Foundation expressly excludes making any promise, undertaking or guarantee&#13;
as to future performance of Entropy Tokens, Entropy Foundation, Hut34 or anything else&#13;
unless expressly stated in these Terms or on the Website in relation to the Token Sale.&#13;
(b) You must not place any reliance on such forward-looking statements. Do not make any&#13;
decision whether to participate in the Token Sale in reliance on any forward looking&#13;
statement.&#13;
14.2 By participating in the Token Sale, and being assigned and controlling and holding Entropy&#13;
Tokens, or using the Website, Entropy Foundation and each other Entropy Foundation Person&#13;
relies on your acknowledgement, for the benefit of all of them, that you acknowledge and agree&#13;
that you fully understand and accept the features and risks of participating in the Token Sale,&#13;
and that no sale or disclosure document could substitute for your own assessment and&#13;
acceptance of those risks.&#13;
14.3 Preserved Liability means:&#13;
(a) any liability which by law may not be excluded, limited or qualified; and&#13;
(b) any liability, or duty for which we are liable, specified in these Terms which we have&#13;
expressly agreed may not be excluded, limited or qualified.&#13;
14.4 Subject to a Preserved Liability and except if directly due to our breach of law, negligence, wilful&#13;
default of these Terms or our dishonesty, to the extent permitted by law, we are not liable to&#13;
Applicant or to any other Entropy Token Owner for the following:&#13;
(a) your participation in the Token Sale, providing funds to Entropy Foundation or receiving,&#13;
controlling and holding Entropy Tokens;&#13;
(b) any access, the use of, or inability to access or use, the Website;&#13;
(c) your reliance on or use or inability to use the content and information of the Website or&#13;
any linked website;&#13;
(d) any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or&#13;
transmission, computer virus or communications line or system failure of the Website or&#13;
any linked website;&#13;
(e) unauthorised access to or alteration of your transmissions or data;&#13;
(f) statements or conduct of any third party on the Website;&#13;
(g) any other matter relating to the Website;&#13;
(h) our acts or omissions in reliance on Applicant’s representations, warranties,&#13;
acknowledgments, confirmations and obligations under these Terms, Applicant’s&#13;
instructions or any other information we have relied upon provided by Applicant including&#13;
by Applicant’s authorised representative, agent or other representative;&#13;
(i) events or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including (without limitation) acts&#13;
of agents and other service providers used by us to perform our obligations under these&#13;
Terms, currency restrictions, disruption of the normal services by others, liquidation or&#13;
insolvency by persons who are not Associates of Entropy Foundation, acts of government&#13;
or their agencies, acts of war or terrorism, riots, revolution or other similar events or acts;&#13;
(j) an act or omission required by law or by a court of competent jurisdiction;&#13;
(k) any actual or asserted fiduciary duty which is not expressly stated in these Terms;&#13;
(l) any payment owing by Applicant or other Entropy Token Owner to a fiscal authority,&#13;
including but not limited to any taxes, levies, stamp duty or government charges;&#13;
(m) any act or omission of an operator of a payment, funds or digicurrency system; and&#13;
(n) economic, indirect or consequential loss, whether or not those losses overlap (including,&#13;
in any case, but not limited to loss of anticipated profits or savings), whether or not&#13;
reasonably foreseeable.&#13;
14.5 Subject to a Preserved Liability, we are not responsible for any Loss or other liability incurred by&#13;
Applicant to the extent arising from us acting or refraining to act within our rights and powers or&#13;
if any transaction or process is interrupted, fails to complete or take place due to the failure of&#13;
any other person’s website, any email, broadband, telephone, messaging or other electronic&#13;
communication service or third party act or omission.&#13;
14.6 To the extent permitted by law, only if our liability to Applicant or other Entropy Token Owner is&#13;
not limited as expressly set out elsewhere in these Terms, then our aggregate liability to&#13;
Applicant under these Terms is limited to the amount Applicant has paid us in the two years&#13;
preceding the breach (valued as at the time of payment to us). If it is determined by a court that&#13;
by law we are not permitted to disclaim or to limit our liability to Applicant or we are not&#13;
permitted to limit the amount of compensation we may be liable for, or any of those limitations&#13;
are unenforceable, then those limits are severed from these Terms as though they were not in it&#13;
from the beginning of application of these Terms to our relationship with Applicant.&#13;
15. Indemnities&#13;
15.1 Subject to a Preserved Liability, Applicant indemnifies us against all losses, claims, damages,&#13;
costs and expenses (including all reasonable legal expenses actually incurred) or any other&#13;
remedies arising directly or indirectly as a result of:&#13;
(a) taxes and other government levies or charges imposed on Applicant or transactions&#13;
made for Applicant;&#13;
(b) Applicant’s breach of these Terms;&#13;
(c) Applicant’s breach of any law or regulation;&#13;
(d) us acting in accordance with Applicant’s instructions or relying on information given by&#13;
Applicant or Applicant’s behalf; and&#13;
(e) claims of any kind by any third parties in relation to our obligations under these Terms,&#13;
except to the extent the claims, damages, costs and expenses were a result of our negligence,&#13;
wilful misconduct or fraud or our breach of these Terms. This provision survives termination of&#13;
these Terms, any agreement formed under it and the completion or other end of the Token&#13;
Sale.&#13;
16. Confidentiality and privacy&#13;
16.1 We will keep confidential all of Applicant’s personal information and all other of Applicant’s&#13;
confidential information so we will not disclose or use it except if one or more of the following&#13;
applies:&#13;
(a) as permitted by law, including when compelled by a notice or order properly issued by a&#13;
regulatory authority;&#13;
(b) as permitted by Applicant; and&#13;
(c) in accordance with these Terms or as permitted by our privacy policy from time to time.&#13;
16.2 We will make reasonable efforts to keep any such information that we have about Applicant&#13;
secure and to ensure that any of our employees or agents who have access to the information&#13;
about Applicant do not make any unauthorised use, modification, reproduction or disclosure of&#13;
that information.&#13;
16.3 We will comply with our privacy policy.&#13;
17. General&#13;
17.1 To the extent this document conflicts with the Website or any other document, including but not&#13;
limited to other Token Sale Documents, these Terms prevail.&#13;
17.2 Time is of the essence of performance of a person’s obligations under these Terms. If these&#13;
Terms specify when the party must perform an obligation or the last time to preform the&#13;
obligation, the party must perform it by the time specified. Each party must perform all other&#13;
obligations promptly.&#13;
17.3 Applicant must pay or provide to us any amount or other consideration due to us in full, without&#13;
deduction or set-off (and irrespective of any counterclaim) whatever.&#13;
17.4 A person with a right arising under these Terms (including an Entropy Foundation Person other&#13;
than Entropy Foundation) may exercise the right in any way it considers appropriate (including&#13;
by imposing conditions), unless these Terms expressly states otherwise. A reference in these&#13;
Terms to Entropy Foundation having a right in its absolute discretion includes Entropy&#13;
Foundation not being bound to make enquiries or to give reasons.&#13;
17.5 A person entitled to a remedy arising under or otherwise in relation to these Terms (including an&#13;
Entropy Foundation Person other than Entropy Foundation) may exercise the remedy in any&#13;
way it considers appropriate.&#13;
17.6 A person whose consent is required under these Terms (including an Entropy Foundation&#13;
Person other than Entropy Foundation) may refuse its consent without having to give reasons&#13;
for that or offer its consent in any way it considers appropriate (including by imposing&#13;
conditions), unless these Terms expressly states otherwise.&#13;
17.7 If a person with the benefit of these Terms does not exercise a right or remedy fully or at a given&#13;
time, the party may still exercise it later.&#13;
17.8 A person is not liable for loss caused by the exercise or attempted exercise of, failure to&#13;
exercise, or delay in exercising, a right or remedy however they arise under or in relation to&#13;
these Terms.&#13;
17.9 By giving its approval or consent, a person does not make or give any warranty or&#13;
representation as to any circumstance relating to the subject matter of the consent or approval.&#13;
17.10 The rights and remedies provided in these Terms are in addition to other rights and remedies&#13;
given by law independently of these Terms.&#13;
17.11 The indemnities and rights to be reimbursed arising under these Terms are continuing&#13;
obligations, independent from the other obligations of persons arising under these Terms and&#13;
continue after the Token Sale ends. It is not necessary for a person to incur expense or make&#13;
payment before enforcing a right of indemnity or reimbursement arising under or in relation to&#13;
these Terms.&#13;
17.12 All notices must be in English. Unless otherwise specified or agreed, all notices may be given&#13;
by a person to the other in writing by email or by other electronic communication service&#13;
acceptable to is (including through our Website).&#13;
17.13 Nothing in the Token Sale or otherwise arising under the Terms may be taken as giving rise to a&#13;
relationship of employment, joint venture or partnership nor as to any agency or fiduciary&#13;
relationships.&#13;
17.14 Failure or neglect by a person to enforce any of the provisions of these Terms must not be&#13;
construed as, nor may be deemed to be, a waiver of their rights arising under these Terms nor&#13;
prejudice their rights to take subsequent action.&#13;
17.15 We only recognise one person as an Applicant or as an Entropy Token Owner. Any application&#13;
made in the name of two or more persons cannot be accepted.&#13;
17.16 Applicant may not assign any agreement arising from the Token Sale or these Terms, because&#13;
it is personal to Applicant. This clause has no effect on the nature or transferability of Entropy&#13;
Tokens.&#13;
17.17 These Terms set out the only terms for the Token Sale. An agreement for sale of Entropy&#13;
Tokens may only arise under these Terms. There may not be any other agreement between&#13;
Applicant and Entropy Foundation (or any other Entropy Foundation Person) in relation to your&#13;
participation in the Token Sale and being assigned, controlling and holding Entropy Tokens.&#13;
17.18 We may amend these Terms by publication of new Terms on our Website.&#13;
(a) Entropy Foundation will not give any other notice of the amendments. Such amendments&#13;
will be effective immediately upon publication on the Website, whether or not you have&#13;
read the amendments or are aware of them.&#13;
(b) The latest version of these Terms will automatically apply to all applications which have&#13;
not been settled by creation of the Entropy Tokens for them.&#13;
(c) If we determine that the amendment may adversely affect applicants for Entropy Tokens&#13;
as a whole (without taking into account any particular applicant), we may in our absolute&#13;
discretion make arrangements which we decide are reasonable for allowing applicants to&#13;
withdraw from the Token Sale.&#13;
(d) We will not be liable for any Loss arising out of any amendment of the Terms or any&#13;
withdrawal by Applicant.&#13;
(e) Entropy Foundation will only amend these Terms for one or more of these&#13;
purposes: if it believes it is reasonable for clarifying any aspect of these&#13;
Terms; to facilitate the proper conduct of the Token Sale; to manage legal or&#13;
taxation requirements (including to respond to a change in law or a policy for&#13;
administering a law); and to prevent or to minimise unlawful conduct.&#13;
17.19 If any term or other provision of these Terms is held by a court to be illegal, invalid or&#13;
unenforceable under the applicable law, then that term or provision is to be interpreted as being&#13;
severed from these Terms and the remaining Terms will be unaffected by that.&#13;
