Subject to an existing Right of Ownership Token Transfer Agreement or otherwise proclaimed possession of ownership of the underlying 

asset ("the Company Equity"), referenced hereafter as "P003_25793", Qwoyn Digital Investments, LLC, (hereafter the “Token Issuer”) 

(the “Purchaser” or the “lien holder”) hereby agrees to tokenize his ownership of  the Company Equity Right granted under the 

Agreement P003_25793, (the “Tokenized Right to Company Equity Revenue”). 

Uploading this Agreement on the blockchain will be hashed and referred in code of a Smart Contract generated by the Token Issuer. 

1. SALE OF THE TOKENIZED RIGHT. 

1.1. The Token Issuer hereby agrees to issue 1000000 Token(s) at the price of as .1 ether 2017-12-06 on the blockchain of the Token 

Issuer’s choice (Ethereum). 

1.2  The Token Issuer hereby reserves the right to issue more tokens dependent on market demand.

2. TOKEN BUYER’S PAYMENT AS CONDITION PRECEDENT. 

2.1. Token Buyer’s (defined in Section 14) payment for the Token(s) issued by Token Issuer under Section 1 is a condition precedent to 

the formation of this Agreement. There will no binding Agreement until the payment from the Token Buyer is appeared in the Token 

Issuer’s ethereum-wallet account. 

2.2. Likewise, there will be no binding agreement with any subsequent token buyer unless the payment for the Token created hereunder 

made to the Token Holder at the moment of selling the Token. 

3. SMART CONTRACT. For the purpose of recording the ownership of the Company Equity Right created under the Agreement P003_25793, 

Token Issuer generates a Smart Contract. This Smart Contract facilitates the direct transfer of the Company Equity Right created to an 

individual or an entity that makes the payment for the Token representing the ownership of the Company Equity Right created under the 

Agreement K003-2017 (the “Token Holder”). 

4. TOKEN HOLDER’S RIGHT. 

4.1. Subject to the Agreement P003_25793, all Token Holder(s) will be granted the right to set a new price for the purchased token 

hereunder, provided that he/she cannot interfere or enforce in the Company Equity Owner’s decision regarding the Company Equity 

subject to the Agreement P003_25793. 

4.2. Subject to the Agreement P003_25793, Token Holder(s)’s Company Equity Right does not create any type of a lien on the Company 

Equity subject to the Agreement P003_25793. Token Holder’s Company Equity Right will be limited to the Right to claim the amount of 

the Company Equity Income promised by the Company Equity Owner to Token Issuer under the Agreement P003_25793. 

5. RIGHT OWNER’S WARRANTIES AND DUTIES. Token Issuer and subsequent Token Holder hereby represent and warrant that, to the best of 

his/her knowledge, he/she is the sole lawful owner of the tokenized Company Equity Right created under the Agreement P003_25793 and 

free and clear of any liens and encumbrances except the ones disclosed to Token Issuer from the Company Equity Owner under the 

Agreement P003_25793. Token Issuer and each subsequent Token Holder(s) have full right, power and authority to sell and transfer 

his/her Right created under the Agreement P003_25793. Token Issuer and each subsequent Token Holder also warrant that he/she does not 

currently know of and has no reason to know of any third party claim to any right, title, or use of the Right created under the 

Agreement P003_25793 except the ones disclosed to Token Issuer from the Company Equity Owner under the Agreement P003_25793. Token 

Issuer and each subsequent Token Holder did not and will not execute any agreement in conflict with this Agreement. Once a token 

purchaser makes the full payment pursuant to Section 1, Token Issuer will take any actions that may be necessary or desirable to 

protect and perfect the Purchaser’s Company Equity Right created under the Agreement P003_25793. 

6. ASSUMPTION OF RISK. 

Each Token Holder bears the risk of loss when purchasing a Token representing the ownership of the Company Equity Right created under 

the Agreement P003_25793. Token Issuer will not be responsible for and will not be liable for any loss arising from: (a) failure or 

malfunction of hardware, software, server, and internet connections; (b) malicious software introduction; (c) the third party may 

obtain unauthorized access to information stored within buyer’s account, including, but not limited to Buyer’s storage address and 

private key; (d) forgotten passwords; and (e) incorrectly constructed transactions or mistyped account address. 

7. DISCLAIMER.

“as-available” basis. Token Holder(s) bears the entire risk, Token Issuer sells the tokenized Company Equity Right to Token Holder(s) 

without any warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and Token Holder(s) acknowledges that no warrant of fitness could be offered

because of the many future technical and legal uncertainties regarding the Tokenized Company Equity Right.

profits.

Holder(s) therefore understands that Token Issuer cannot predict how the value of the Tokenized Right will change, the consumer 

demand for the Tokenized Right, technical difficulties in or modification to the peer-to-peer blockchain network, change of 

regulations, and all other obstacles that a peer-to-peer blockchain network might face. All Token Holder(s) affirmatively represents 

that he/she is a sophisticated blockchain users and therefore knowingly assumes all known and unknown risk of loss. All Token Holder(s)

whatsoever causes.

government for each country may apply and enforce the existing laws or regulate the Tokenized Right or other peer-to-peer blockchain 

based exchange technologies in the future. All Token Holder(s) understands that there is a high level of uncertainty, and all Token 

Holder(s) assumes that all financial regulatory risk inherent in operating and transferring the Tokenized Right. 

All Token Holder(s) has no recourse whatsoever against Token Issuer for damages, civil and criminal, suffered by each Token Holder(s) 

due to regulatory enforcement. Token Issuer does not and cannot warrant that the exercise or transfer of the Tokenized Company Equity 

Right is legal in all specific jurisdiction of each country. Token Issuer has not duty to advise or warn to each Token Holder(s) and 

each Token Holder(s) will not advise or warn Token Issuer about any particular legal or regulatory requirement(s). Each Token Holder(s)

is solely obligated to understand the laws and regulations of its local jurisdiction before exercising, selling, or purchasing the 

Tokenized Right, and Token Holder(s) is solely responsible for any of its actions that may be unlawful.
